<pre>
Using Erlang on Mac OSX with kernel poll enabled (+K true)?
Can't go past 1024 fds?
OTP won't fix, so edit FD_SETSIZE in /usr/include/sys/select.h

More precisely,
change __DARWIN_FD_SETSIZE in /usr/include/sys/_structs.h
and recompile Erlang with --enable-kernel-poll among other things.
</pre>

Just wanted to save this somewhere, and try out the quote blocks too :)
