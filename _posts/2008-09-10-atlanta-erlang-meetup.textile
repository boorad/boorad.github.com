p(meta). 10 Sep 2008 - Atlanta

The "Metro Atlanta Erlang Users Group":http://groups.google.com/group/maeug, some single digits strong, will meet for the first time on September 20, 2008 at the "Brick Store Pub":http://local.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=brick+store+pub,+decatur,+ga&ie=UTF8&z=14&iwloc=A in Decatur, GA.  For now, we are planning on meeting at 7pm.

The Brick Store has a fairly amazing beer selection, and they're light on the TV's so we can hopefully avoid the rabid Tech and Dawg football fans.  Let's sit upstairs if possible.

Please throw out suggestions for what to talk about in the comments, or we can just get together and meet/drink.  I can talk about a project I've got cooking, and my trials with backends, including CouchDB vs. Mnesia.  "Kevin Smith":http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/ says he will be there, so we can possibly guide his pragpodcast direction :)

Wifi is a bit iffy.  Decatur is blanketed, but I'm not sure if it's free.  I believe you need to be a resident.  So, that means I'll be calling on my friend who lives over there.  Happily, he's at least heard of Erlang.

Oh, and in addition to Erlang, I try to indoctrinate as many as I run into about the hotness of the "D Programming Language":http://digitalmars.com/d.  You have been warned.
